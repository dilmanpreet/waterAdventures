	     I plan to start a water adventure business in Vishakhapatnam. The website will feature different services our company will offer. There will be an About section that will contain our companyâ€™s backstory and our mission with which we started the business. The Services section will list prices of all the rental services we offer which include: Paddleboards, Kayaks, Surfboards etc. The sign up page will allow visitors to become registered members. There will also be a login section where members can login to rent services online and there will be special member-only discounts. There will be a Contact Us section where people can view our contact information and our locations with google maps. The Calendar section will allow people to check for future events hosted by us. There will be a Gear Store where people can buy their own water sports gear such as swimsuits, goggles, etc.
